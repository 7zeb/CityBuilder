## THIS ISN'T FINISHED YET, IT PROBABLY WILL NOT WORK

# CityBuilder 🏙️

CityBuilder is an open-source Spigot plugin that lets you quickly spawn filler buildings and structures in Minecraft.  
It’s designed to help server owners, builders, and communities populate towns and cities with ease—whether you’re prototyping layouts, filling empty plots, or immortalizing lore-rich worlds.

---

## ✨ Features
- **Command-driven building placement**: `/fillerbuilding <template>` (e.g. `/fillerbuilding rc:skyscraper_4`)
- **Modular templates**: stores, warehouses, skyscrapers, apartments, and more
- **Permissions system**: control who can spawn filler buildings
- **Community-driven**: add your own templates and share them via pull requests
- **Future support**: WorldEdit `.schem` integration for complex structures

## 🚀 Installation
1. Download the latest release from [Releases](./releases).
2. Place the `.jar` file into your server’s `plugins/` folder.
3. Restart your server.

## 🛠️ Usage
